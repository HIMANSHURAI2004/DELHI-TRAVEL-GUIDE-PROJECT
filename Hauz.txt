It was a nice place to hangout with your friends. Historic vibes with pleasant atmosphere. Enjoying amd minding your own business makes the place more diverse. Like you can explore the history behind that place, sit aside, roam around, play around.

We prefer to visit the fort rather than deer park because of the limited time. But we got the best shorts from the fort. The lush green garden , clear sky and lake view adds beauty to nature. Only online mode of tickets were available. Outside the fort is a small market and restaurants , where you can enjoy food.

If you are visiting New Delhi, you should visit the Hauz Khas fort. It's beautiful, the view of sun setting from the fort is gorgeous. The reservoir and the fountains in it add more beauty to the area. There is a mini zoo and a park near the fort. You can buy tickets at the entrance or you can book online
