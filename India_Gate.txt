This tourist attraction is different and beautiful. The gate has very rich history.
Itâ€™s magnificent!!! During the evenings, the edifice lights up beautifully in Indian National Colors.
There was very large crowd present and police presence as well. You can get small chops, food, confectionery, traditional pastries, souvenirs and many great things to purchase.

After renovation it looks amazing. All the pathways are looking so beautiful.
Memorized by the National War Memorial. All bricks with the name of all War Martyr name just give us goosebumps.
