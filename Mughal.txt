I visited on Friday 2pm slot. Heat was not unbearable because trees provide cover. Time slot is not strict. Free parking is on road at gate no.35, garden entry gate. You may not find such flowers anywhere else.  Click plenty of pictures. Do carry full water bottle because water is at the end.

We went on Sunday for the 4pm slot and the place was very very overcrowded. Instead of being able to enjoy and see the flowers, we were jostling with the crowd for most of the time. The concerned authorities should really do some capacity planning and only allow the number of people whom they can manage.

It is open to the general public only for a short duration in February - March every year. The garden is simply amazing with beautiful flowers and greenery all around. Definitely worth a visit.
