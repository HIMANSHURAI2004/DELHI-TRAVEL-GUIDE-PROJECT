Purana Qila and Lake is a great place for a leisurely morning walk. Not too many people go here in the mornings and it lets one enjoy the beauty of the place without too many people around. The monuments inside are well-maintained and lawns are manicured.

The number of couples getting busy in this place is horrifying. Technically the authorities should be more strict in such areas since it's a monumental place visited by a huge number of children, families, and foreigners.

One of the many monuments in Delhi. Spread across acres of land. Well maintained garden around the ruins. Its also got a museum inside. The fee for museum is separate and can be paid along with entry charges at the gate.

The overal cost was 45. The lake was beautiful. The museum was poorly maintained and no proper lighting. The garden is a good area to rest. It was built by sheer Shah and what attracted me was the yellow stone. Comparing to other forts this was very basic and normal. Overall good time to spend and explore.
